// There is no specific view logic for CountryListView as it is purely a lookup list for countries.
// Data for the view (countries list) is held/taken from UserDetailView and its model holds the logic to set country code in the Model.

// This file is only retained for convention, just to show view models for each view controller and to facilitate changes.
